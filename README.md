## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using time series analysis. The goal is to develop models that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data and patterns.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a stock market dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs). It contains historical stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial information.

## Dependencies
The following libraries were used in this project:
- NumPy 🧮
- Pandas 🐼
- Seaborn 🌊
- Matplotlib 📊
- Flask 🌐
- PyTorch 🔥

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, and missing values were handled appropriately. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis were performed to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or anomalies.

3. Time Series Analysis: Different time series forecasting methods were explored, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. These models were trained on the historical stock price data to predict future prices.

4. Model Evaluation: The performance of the models was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

5. Deployment: A Flask web application was developed to provide an interactive interface for users to input stock symbols and view predicted stock prices.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git](https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git)


2. Install the required dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the dataset. Download the stock market dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

4. Train the models:
This will train the time series models on the historical stock price data.

5. Run the Flask web application:
Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

Feel free to customize the project or modify the code to suit your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out for support.

## Results
The project provides predictions for future stock prices based on historical data and time series analysis. The models aim to capture patterns and trends in the stock market, assisting users in making informed decisions.

## Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to further enhance the project:

- Implement more advanced time series models, such as Prophet or deep learning architectures like Transformer.
- Incorporate additional data sources, such as news sentiment or macroeconomic indicators, to improve prediction accuracy.
- Enhance the web application with interactive charts and customizable settings.
